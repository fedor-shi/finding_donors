    "## Getting Started\n",
    "\n",
    "In this project, you will employ several supervised algorithms of your choice to accurately model individuals' income using data collected from the 1994 U.S. Census. You will then choose the best candidate algorithm from preliminary results and further optimize this algorithm to best model the data. Your goal with this implementation is to construct a model that accurately predicts whether an individual makes more than $50,000. This sort of task can arise in a non-profit setting, where organizations survive on donations.  Understanding an individual's income can help a non-profit better understand how large of a donation to request, or whether or not they should reach out to begin with.  While it can be difficult to determine an individual's general income bracket directly from public sources, we can (as we will see) infer this value from other publically available features. \n",
    "\n",
    "The dataset for this project originates from the [UCI Machine Learning Repository](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Census+Income). The datset was donated by Ron Kohavi and Barry Becker, after being published in the article _\"Scaling Up the Accuracy of Naive-Bayes Classifiers: A Decision-Tree Hybrid\"_. You can find the article by Ron Kohavi [online](https://www.aaai.org/Papers/KDD/1996/KDD96-033.pdf). The data we investigate here consists of small changes to the original dataset, such as removing the `'fnlwgt'` feature and records with missing or ill-formatted entries."

    "## Preparing the Data\n",
    "Before data can be used as input for machine learning algorithms, it often must be cleaned, formatted, and restructured — this is typically known as **preprocessing**. Fortunately, for this dataset, there are no invalid or missing entries we must deal with, however, there are some qualities about certain features that must be adjusted. This preprocessing can help tremendously with the outcome and predictive power of nearly all learning algorithms."

    "### Transforming Skewed Continuous Features\n",
    "A dataset may sometimes contain at least one feature whose values tend to lie near a single number, but will also have a non-trivial number of vastly larger or smaller values than that single number.  Algorithms can be sensitive to such distributions of values and can underperform if the range is not properly normalized. With the census dataset two features fit this description: '`capital-gain'` and `'capital-loss'`. \n",

    "For highly-skewed feature distributions such as `'capital-gain'` and `'capital-loss'`, it is common practice to apply a <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Data_transformation_(statistics)\">logarithmic transformation</a> on the data so that the very large and very small values do not negatively affect the performance of a learning algorithm. Using a logarithmic transformation significantly reduces the range of values caused by outliers. Care must be taken when applying this transformation however: The logarithm of `0` is undefined, so we must translate the values by a small amount above `0` to apply the the logarithm successfully.\n",

Applying a scaling to the data does not change the shape of each feature's distribution (such as `'capital-gain'` or `'capital-loss'` above); however, normalization ensures that each feature is treated equally when applying supervised learners. Note that once scaling is applied, observing the data in its raw form will no longer have the same original meaning, as exampled below.\n",
    "\n",
    "Run the code cell below to normalize each numerical feature. We will use [`sklearn.preprocessing.MinMaxScaler`](http://scikit-learn.org/stable/modules/generated/sklearn.preprocessing.MinMaxScaler.html) for this."

    "\n",
    "From the table in **Exploring the Data** above, we can see there are several features for each record that are non-numeric. Typically, learning algorithms expect input to be numeric, which requires that non-numeric features (called *categorical variables*) be converted. One popular way to convert categorical variables is by using the **one-hot encoding** scheme. One-hot encoding creates a _\"dummy\"_ variable for each possible category of each non-numeric feature. For example, assume `someFeature` has three possible entries: `A`, `B`, or `C`. We then encode this feature into `someFeature_A`, `someFeature_B` and `someFeature_C`.\n",

    "| 1 |  C  | ----> one-hot encode ----> | 0 | 0 | 1 |\n",
    "| 2 |  A  |  | 1 | 0 | 0 |\n",
    "\n",
    "Additionally, as with the non-numeric features, we need to convert the non-numeric target label, `'income'` to numerical values for the learning algorithm to work. Since there are only two possible categories for this label (\"<=50K\" and \">50K\"), we can avoid using one-hot encoding and simply encode these two categories as `0` and `1`, respectively. In code cell below, you will need to implement the following:\n",
    " - Use [`pandas.get_dummies()`](http://pandas.pydata.org/pandas-docs/stable/generated/pandas.get_dummies.html?highlight=get_dummies#pandas.get_dummies) to perform one-hot encoding on the `'features_log_minmax_transform'` data.\n",

    "### Metrics and the Naive Predictor\n",
    "*CharityML*, equipped with their research, knows individuals that make more than \\$50,000 are most likely to donate to their charity. Because of this, *CharityML* is particularly interested in predicting who makes more than \\$50,000 accurately. It would seem that using **accuracy** as a metric for evaluating a particular model's performace would be appropriate. Additionally, identifying someone that *does not* make more than \\$50,000 as someone who does would be detrimental to *CharityML*, since they are looking to find individuals willing to donate. Therefore, a model's ability to precisely predict those that make more than \\$50,000 is *more important* than the model's ability to **recall** those individuals. We can use **F-beta score** as a metric that considers both precision and recall:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$ F_{\\beta} = (1 + \\beta^2) \\cdot \\frac{precision \\cdot recall}{\\left( \\beta^2 \\cdot precision \\right) + recall} $$\n",
    "\n",
    "In particular, when $\\beta = 0.5$, more emphasis is placed on precision. This is called the **F$_{0.5}$ score** (or F-score for simplicity).\n",
    "\n",
    "Looking at the distribution of classes (those who make at most \\$50,000, and those who make more), it's clear most individuals do not make more than \\$50,000. This can greatly affect **accuracy**, since we could simply say *\"this person does not make more than \\$50,000\"* and generally be right, without ever looking at the data! Making such a statement would be called **naive**, since we have not considered any information to substantiate the claim. It is always important to consider the *naive prediction* for your data, to help establish a benchmark for whether a model is performing well. That been said, using that prediction would be pointless: If we predicted all people made less than \\$50,000, *CharityML* would identify no one as donors. \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Note: Recap of accuracy, precision, recall\n",
    "\n",
    "** Accuracy ** measures how often the classifier makes the correct prediction. It’s the ratio of the number of correct predictions to the total number of predictions (the number of test data points).\n",
    "\n",
    "** Precision ** tells us what proportion of messages we classified as spam, actually were spam.\n",
    "It is a ratio of true positives(words classified as spam, and which are actually spam) to all positives(all words classified as spam, irrespective of whether that was the correct classificatio), in other words it is the ratio of\n",
    "\n",
    "`[True Positives/(True Positives + False Positives)]`\n",
    "\n",
    "** Recall(sensitivity)** tells us what proportion of messages that actually were spam were classified by us as spam.\n",
    "It is a ratio of true positives(words classified as spam, and which are actually spam) to all the words that were actually spam, in other words it is the ratio of\n",
    "\n",
    "`[True Positives/(True Positives + False Negatives)]`\n",
    "\n",
    "For classification problems that are skewed in their classification distributions like in our case, for example if we had a 100 text messages and only 2 were spam and the rest 98 weren't, accuracy by itself is not a very good metric. We could classify 90 messages as not spam(including the 2 that were spam but we classify them as not spam, hence they would be false negatives) and 10 as spam(all 10 false positives) and still get a reasonably good accuracy score. For such cases, precision and recall come in very handy. These two metrics can be combined to get the F1 score, which is weighted average(harmonic mean) of the precision and recall scores. This score can range from 0 to 1, with 1 being the best possible F1 score(we take the harmonic mean as we are dealing with ratios)."

Features are based on global statistics derived from pitch, energy, MFCCs, duration, voice quality and spectral information. Currently, two classifiers are integrated into the framework: Naive Bayes as a fast but [simple classifier](https://www.informatik.uni-augsburg.de/en/chairs/hcm/projects/tools/emovoice/img/emovoice_system.jpg), and Support Vector Machines as a more sophisticated classifier.\n",

In such case we definitely want the fast classification method with the low computation cost, which Naive Bayes method is. However, it's obvious that it could be a reason for overfitting of the model. I would like to choose this algorithm contrary to logic to see it in practice and compare it with other candidates.\n",

Decision trees are an easy method of representing frequencies of attributes we suspect can provide insights, helping to predict an outcome. They can be very useful to analyse probable causes of good and bad business outcomes, and help us improve our service levels, increase customer retention or prevent fraud, among many other applications.\n",

However, since trees can handle qualitative predictors, there is no need to create dummy variables and we could skip this step when the data were prepared. I am interested to try the decision tree classifier in contrast of Naive Bayes because the decision tree makes no assumptions of the training data or prediction residuals; e.g., no distributional, independence, or constant variance assumptions and might show better result.\n",

    "I want to drop Descision Tree because it overfitted with the default parameters. The F score is almost 1 on the training data and drops to 6.1 on the test data. The model memorized the answers but can not generalize. Next I want to drop the GaussianNB. It has the highest prediction time and the lowest F score for the train and test datasets. Let's proceed with the Logic Regression. It predicts quite fast and has the high F score even with out any customization. The F score is almost 0.7 for the train and test datasets. It means model can generalize and can make prediction on the new(unseen) data and has a good balance between Precision and Recall. The Logic Regression has high training time but very law prediction time. Which means it could be difficult to re train it, but good to have serving a traffic in the production from the performance point of view. Based on the F-score, accuracy and time measuments we cleary can see that the Logic Regression model suitable for the data set in contrast with the GaussianNB and Descision Tree."

    "We trained the model and deployed it to the production for your organization. For the model we use [Logistic regression](https://towardsdatascience.com/machine-learning-part-3-logistics-regression-9d890928680f). Logistic regression is a statistical method for analysing a dataset in which there are one or more independent variables that determine an outcome. The outcome is measured with a dichotomous variable (in which there are only two possible outcomes). After that, you can send the users features to make predictions. The model gives us a number from 0..1 based on the input of user features. The closer this value is to 1, the more likely it is that the person earns more than 50 thousand a year. Let's say that if the model predicts the value more than 0.8 most probably you could ask the user for the donation for CharityML. It would be good if CharityML could save the results of how the prediction helped get donations or not. Later we would be able to train the model more successfully on this data as well.\n",

    "Logistic Regression is generally used for classification purposes. Unlike Linear Regression, the dependent variable can take a limited number of values only i.e, the dependent variable is categorical. When the number of possible outcomes is only two it is called Binary Logistic Regression. [The activation function](https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1600/1*8q9ztX9dGVCv7e0DmH_IVA.png) that is used is known as the sigmoid function. The plot of the [sigmoid function](https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1600/1*yKvimZ3MCAX-rwMX2n87nw.png) looks like. We can see that the value of the sigmoid function always lies between 0 and 1. The value is exactly 0.5 at X=0. We can use 0.5 as the probability threshold to determine the classes. If the probability is greater than 0.5, we classify it as >50k income(Y=1) or else as <=50k(Y=0). The assumptions made by Logistic Regression:\n",
    "* The dependent variable must be categorical.\n",
    "* The independent variables(features) must be independent (to avoid multicollinearity).\n",

Also, I tried to keep the only solvers which support the l1, l2 penalties, and other variations. If there is no mistake in my coding, I am interested if it a case that unoptimized model performing even better and we can not improve it, what is the scientific confirmation? Could we see it in our dataset? I asked the [question on StackOverflow](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/55746021/sklearn-logisticregression-a-proof-that-a-model-could-not-be-improved) and will try to figure it out with my mentor."

I believe that every person who has an interest in how to manage their capital will succeed to make more money at some point. Let's call it financial maturity. The occupation makes a lot of sense in the majority of cases. The next one I want to pick up marital status. Usually, people who are married tend to keep the same job and be more stable. For a lot of professions it easier to grow with the career and salary staying in the same company. For sure it is not true all the time, but for most people, it should be a valid strategy. I pick up the education level to the last position. In nowadays education is not so important to succeed in money context, but anyway I guess it could bring some benefits in profession area.\n"

    "How does a model perform if we only use a subset of all the available features in the data? With less features required to train, the expectation is that training and prediction time is much lower — at the cost of performance metrics. From the visualization above, we see that the top five most important features contribute more than half of the importance of **all** features present in the data. This hints that we can attempt to *reduce the feature space* and simplify the information required for the model to learn. The code cell below will use the same optimized model you found earlier, and train it on the same training set *with only the top five important features*. "

We do the future selection picking up over dummy variables. Maybe in our case, it could be better to take not just futures, but take age, hours_per_week, capital_gain, all the variations of the relationship_* and marital_status_* and drop all other. It will be still a lot of features, but anyway, reduce some of them and will not corrupt F-score so much."
